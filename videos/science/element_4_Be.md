# Byrillium
## periodic elemnt Number Four

<body>

	What happens's within the gaseous, potent center of a start. No one really knows becuase no one has gone there and back and liv3e to tell the tale. what can be said is: SCIEMCE! by collecting the data we can beginh to comocomorehend what is happenihng at all levels. for example, todays element Be (Byriullium) is a rare pepp element made within the solar process.

consider the following questions:

- what happens in the star to produce elemts? 
- why is byrillium a hard-brittle phenomena at room temperatures?
where is the element found?
is it a metal?
what other kinds of elemts are there?
what is the chemical makeup of byrillium and how far is that even a valid question?
where do physical and quemistry intersect inasmuch a symantic discpline is concerned. i mean to point out the relateability of physics and cemistry how both are concerned with matter and action reaction. 

WCIENCE.

where here.


according to reference, refrerring kazium linux app, byrillium had been discovered in the late 18th centurty; the man who discovered it whoms name i cannot recall had called it after greek byrillos light gren stone. indeed the reader conjures thrice images

light green stone
light stone green
stone light green
stone green light
green stone light
green light stone


this permutation displays the glory of the expanding universe. nature is constant. a singular point holds within the infinite without. therefore what of nurture? could it be said technology itself is the burture of the universe allowing birth of greatest man? 

creation. man is kind and kind is wo, wo, woah man! whatever concept allows us to hrul heaps of byrillium at tom papalo. becuase he's my betst friend? becyase im a warrior? becuase the birds?

there is a quality to byrillium that most would like to know about. dedecutively the compostion: fourth element. atomic mass four equal. varous isotpes

hard brittle physical 
needs water. the element needs hydrogen and oxygen. that would transform it for being mineral.

seriosuly though i listen imgiantionus and byrillium is crawling on the grdeser dirt dragging his leggless body with them white mickey mouse hands panting out loud repeatdly "water! again repaeting as if some gentrified element comes up and pours water on him. "water" and this lop goes on and on. he brittle. he loopy. but he aint dead. 

my friend.

in conclusion, byrillium is an essential minearal element and if it has any value they are selling it on the markets. for example, gold is up from janurary and thats great! how can bryillium decay? what does decay look like under a microscope? where are  the hen and chick peas? (sidenote): the element has that nickname hen and chicken: quote unsubstantiated. the substahnce of consume is eat spend allocate redistribute.
