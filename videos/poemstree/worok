I thank my heart

i thank for hearts will'd beating resting
nothing like'd nor nothing'd lacking
where here who I imagine content

as high and low come smiling

absorbs the blow one weeping bellow
as to sand they'd call my fellow

towards a rip a wraith and rapture
i am the being garnish capture

to peel and peddle
like toil and maylord
upon these qint tanna ram hare

i shake my eat truth pon the dust 

i am that non nothing more

a word wrinkled l'yet boundless

no man knows the funeral scene
that those who tell are still and wretched

i can sell a flip a dime 
god thank my beltane feels sow fine

on word on verb on ropes and curtails
a spiral golden shapes our destiny

the buried best l'yon l'yet for coming
these are the days i dream of genie

thanks on jesus buddha christ 
i administer thy calling

towards a still a calm foretold 7

Thank you
