These are the shackles
see them my bounded
where fraternal regard has sex to reflect
none perscription rest vertias est tres quid

yon luxe per chance would have mild a pence
a nickel of bands the lines care me upward
l'yet whom am i who flys fast hard andino
revision once twic i am scorneth lull 
the flower is reputable like a shower of love

i pace in my preference 
soothing phantoms and fairies

i lift as i push 

i am not I

once alone so w i life as a broad range of color i am that i sense
more mores that is crossed

more

more that i am i shadow on stilts coming upon my wit rest wake jumping

telling tallies upon the delux semior package i set upon these alatte

in variable clutter there is once wupon a time to shout nothing lusting in godspeed i am found

a problem is this a problem is that more people want skinny when children a fat

i notice the patter and pitter of breathe

who am i south the north as it freezes

a candle left rituraul 
to once have called one disease
if chocolate is pattern then a greenery i aim please

the left and the firht the firth and the laps

to whom i run this race i pray good rheels never collapse.

the spirit is happy the body is broken to awere that i am concious great spoken

no matza no elftza i have me a light

that arnold and rogan and oswald crown through delight

the shudder is binding and bound that i am

the dream of this yeoman that's all that i can

no stilts for an ego no beer for their maidens 

what tells me i dancing is mother's fair blessing

reamin and maintain pon line 26 i knew time a per tis a fond heavy set setter

and now that i've said all these what's more

i would not nor will not

i will yes i bear fruit that wit by and large

theres nothing to rise up the air is green rosey

Here is the chain
See my limits
Think about where the brother is
