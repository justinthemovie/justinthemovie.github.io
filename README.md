# Character Analysis
Based on the information supplied about 'liberty and justice for all', Narrative Nods considers the characters to have been planned successfully.


## In more Detail:

• The protagonist and the antagonist are designed in a non-stereotypical way. That's great!

• In terms of designing the protagonist, there is a good balance between acting and thinking. Great!

• The dreamer and the chorus are designed so that whereas one is ignored, the other is respected. This is, generally speaking, a good choice as it increases narrative tension.

• Both the protagonist and the antagonist have been designed as inconsistent. This can increase complexity and, conceivably, favor surprising narrative evolutions. However, if not properly explored, it can also lead to avoidable endings (see Glossary below).



# Narrative Evolution
Based on the information supplied about 'liberty and justice for all', Narrative Nods considers the narrative evolution to have been planned successfully.


## In more Detail:

• The goal is achieved by the end of the narrative, and the goal is closer in the Journey from Becoming to Assessment. That's great! Narratives where the goal is farther before the last Journey often resort to artificial plot solutions which typically lead to a "Surprising and Avoidable" type ending (see further below).

• The protagonist needs to recall the past, however, the Journey to The Past does not primarily involve the protagonist.
Suggestion:
Consider changing your narrative plan so that the Journey to The Past mostly involves the protagonist.

• In terms of genre, the narrative balances nicely between reader expectations and narrative cohesion. Great!



# Narrative Endings
Based on the information supplied, Narrative Nods estimates that the narrative ending of 'liberty and justice for all' falls into the 'Predictable and Avoidable' category.


## In more Detail:

A narrative ending that is predictable and avoidable is not as bad as one might think. Indeed, in certain genres (e.g. fantasy or science fiction), an ending that is predictable and avoidable is probably the norm. Does that make it ideal? Probably not, but it is still acceptable.

If such an ending is not something you are satisfied with, these are some things to consider:

• To change a predictable-and-avoidable ending, focus on the latter aspect, that is, avoidability. Try to strengthen then narrative evolution in a way that makes the solution the only one that makes narrative sense. For example, try to eliminate any narrative possibilities along the way that could have explained things in some way.

If the detective needed several months to solve the crime because he didn't listen to some witness introduced in chapter 5, perhaps the reader should be made aware of (far before the ending, to avoid surprise-but-avoidable endings) that this witness did not possess accurate information.

Do not try to make the ending more surprising. A predictable-and-avoidable ending is still better than surprising-and-avoidable.

Glossary & Reference
Characters
• Stereotypical characters
By stereotypical characters we mean characters that are designed according to genre expectations. Think of the alcoholic, corrupt cop whom nobody trusts having to solve a case in detective fiction; or in romantic fiction, of the arrogant self-centered male love interest whom the protagonist hates to love.
Generally speaking, you should try to avoid this.


• Action-driven vs thinking protagonists
Action-driven protagonists act first, then try to ponder on the repercussions of their actions. Conversely, thinking protagonists think (sometimes too much) before any action. Either option by itself is fine, but when certain other parameters are also met, it can be problematic. For instance, you should try to avoid having action-driven protagonists to act even more to approach the goal. Even genre fiction (adventure or thrillers, for instance) requires some thinking!


• Ignored or Respected?
This option applies to the characters of the dreamer and the chorus. In this context, to be respected simply means for the protagonist to be influenced by this character. In other words, there is no ethical dimension implied. An evil cold-blooded murderer who is hated by everyone but who affects the protagonist's acting or thinking is considered respected in this context.


• Changing the environment vs changing one's self
Protagonists who need to change their environment to achieve the goal, tend to see the problem outside themselves.
Conversely, protagonists who need to change themselves believe (correctly or erroneously is another matter) that the problem lies in their own way of thinking or acting.


• Altruistic vs self-centered
This option applies to assistants and opponents. The expected thing to have is an altruistic assistant and a self-centered opponent. But sometimes the expected solution is not necessarily the best one.
More narrative tension can be produced with altruistic (but misguided) opponents or self-centered (but accurate in their thinking) assistants.
Remember that assistants and opponents can perform their roles unintentionally, for example having a friend of the protagonist acting as the misguided and accidental opponent, who unwillingly steers the protagonist away from the goal.


• Restless vs content
An option related to protagonists and antagonists. In the context of Narrative Nods, to be restless or content has to do primarily with the drive to either change a situation or maintain the status quo.
Restless protagonists are unhappy with the way things are, whereas content ones might find themselves in the midst of a situation they did not instigate.

Narrative Evolution
• Ambiguity in the Outcome
Stories don't always need to have clear-cut, definite conclusions. What is more important is their narrative cohesion and inevitability. In other words, as long as the narrative is structured in a way that leads to a narrow set of possible conclusions (or, ideally, only one), then it's not necessary for it to be offered in an explicit manner. Often an author might leave an outcome open-ended to allow the reader to 'choose' their favorite conclusion. Did the protagonist survive or not? Is the antagonist truly vanquished? The reader can provide the answer!


• The drive for the Journey to The Past
There can be several reasons for the Journey from the Status Quo to The Past. It can be inspired as a result of actions or thoughts, desire to obtain or fear of losing, volition or chance.
The differences (which can sometimes be very subtle) are to be found in the way The Past is connected with the Status Quo, affecting the character journeying (usually but not always, that is the protagonist).
A veteran suffering from PTSD recalls old battles as a result of a piano falling from a balcony, almost killing him. This is a Journey based on actions and chance.
If instead of a falling piano the story involved the veteran recalling the past as a result of an activity he performed himself (e.g. wanting to discover what happened to old army comrades), then we would have a case of volition instead.


• Confirmed vs questioned ideas
During the Journey from The Past to Becoming, ideas are either confirmed or questioned. As with most other options in Narrative Nods, this is presented as a binary choice (i.e. either/or), whereas in a story some ideas might be confirmed and others might be questioned.
The key in understanding the dynamics involved is to see the matter in terms of protagonist motivation.
In other words, protagonists who believe their ideas are confirmed, tend to seek solutions (perhaps erroneously, perhaps not) in The Past, whereas protagonists who believe their ideas are questioned, tend to seek solutions (again, perhaps erroneously, perhaps not) in Becoming.

Narrative Endings
In the context of Narrative Nods, there are 4 possible narrative endings:


• Surprising and inevitable
This is the ideal outcome, the one you should be aiming for. A narrative conclusion should be both surprising (in the sense that it's not stereotypical) yet also absolutely necessary, considering the narrative preceding it.
Would you like an example? Take The Green Mile, for instance. The ending is inevitable, because any ending where the character of John Coffey would survive would be unacceptable – it would render the plot meaningless. At the same time, however, it is also surprising, because the reader ultimately realizes the age of the narrator – Paul Edgecombe – and the repercussions involved.


• Surprising and avoidable
A narrative ending that is surprising but avoidable comes off as cheap. It screams "authorial trickery", and leaving a reader with such a taste is not good at all. To say that an ending is surprising and avoidable is basically a fancier way of referring to a Deus Ex Machina ending.
Basically, the plot has stalled so much in terms of narrative journeying, that the author (unable to resolve it) comes up with a fanciful, improbable solution. It comes off as surprising but, since it is avoidable, the reader feels cheated. Many low-quality crime-fiction narratives work like that: a character is introduced a little before the ending, and the entire solution is predicated on his/her presence. Sometimes even the murderer shows up a couple of chapters before the conclusion, out of thin air.


• Predictable and inevitable
Although not ideal, this ending is preferable to the one right above. Narrative endings that are inevitable are structurally solid: the narrative has reached a logical conclusion, and the entire story has arrived at the point it was meant to arrive. Perhaps it comes off as a bit stereotypical, but it is a better feeling to leave the reader with, as long as it was an inevitable ending.
Take as an example Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The ending is quite predictable (who would expect any of the "good guys" in such a film to die?) and also inevitable: the holy grail cannot give eternal life (unless you remain in the confines of the temple), because that would throw the world into chaos. Additionally, the character of Elsa Schneider must die, because of her deeds during the film (at least considering the logic of the story).


• Predictable and avoidable
This is a weird case. You would instinctively think it is a really bad outcome, but this is not necessarily the case. It is still better than a surprising-but-avoidable ending. Indeed, in certain genres such as fantasy or science fiction, an ending that is predictable and avoidable is probably the norm.
Does that make it ideal? Perhaps not, but it is probably still acceptable. The reason it is more acceptable in such genres, is because of their intrinsic nature. In such narratives there is greater latitude for the Deus ex Machina factor. In other words, in fantasy or science fiction it feels less of a "cheat" to bend the "rules" a bit. It is still a bit sloppy, though.
